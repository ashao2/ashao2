  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>This is my personal website.
    It's brand new and very much a work in progress.
    I'm attemping to build everything from scratch myself.
    This way, I'll (eventually) have an end product I can really be proud of.
    And I can learn HTML and CSS along the way!

  <h1>About</h1>
  <p> I am a college senior (class of 2021) studying linguistics.
    I'm interested in using computational techiques to explore language.
    How can I use programming to do somore efficiently?
    For example, in Spring 2020 I decided to create a small corpus of Chinese names to explore what characters were most common in male and female names.
    Data collection and processing was rather laborious, and I used Excel for my analysis, which was not ideal.
    Currently, I'm working on a Python script to more quickly conduct the analysis.
    I'm also hoping to learn about webscrapping so that data collection can also become more efficient.
    I can't get back the time I spent fiddling with Excel, but I can improve my approach and collect even more data next time!
